## 0.1.0 - 2020-01-25

This is the initial release to crates.io of the feature-complete driver (with
support for SHTC3). There may be some API changes in the future, in case I
decide that something can be further improved. Furthermore, support for SHTC1
and maybe other devices of this series will be added. All changes will be
documented in this CHANGELOG.
